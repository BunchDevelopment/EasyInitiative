            <p>Easy Initiative has a single goal. To make it easier to roll that initiative so you can have more fun playing, and killing monsters than trying to figure out initiative for the party AND the monsters. With a DM section and player section, you can ensure that the party is surprised by what they fight, and when they get to move. While the DM knows who (or what) they're fighting, the players will only see the initiative order of their party.</p>
